Traditional car rental systems come with several challenges that make the process time-consuming and inefficient. Customers often have to deal with lengthy paperwork, slow booking procedures, and uncertainty about car availability. These manual processes lead to delays and frustration, making it difficult for users to rent a car quickly when needed. On the other hand, rental businesses struggle with managing their fleet, keeping track of bookings, and ensuring secure payment transactions. Without a streamlined system, both customers and rental service providers face inefficiencies that impact their overall experience.

      To address these issues, we propose a web-based Car Rental System that simplifies the entire process, making it faster, more convenient, and secure. Our platform allows users to browse available cars in real time, make instant bookings, and complete payments through a secure online system. For rental businesses, an admin dashboard provides tools to efficiently manage vehicle listings, track bookings, and oversee customer transactions. By eliminating manual paperwork and automating key operations, our solution enhances the rental experience for both users and service providers, ensuring a smoother, more reliable, and hassle-free car rental process.
